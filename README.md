# encryption_website_python

I am very interested in cyber security and online privacy. So when I first started learning about cryptography I was hooked, and a few of my mates and I would write simple ciphers to each other that we would have to decrypt. I have been on a never ending quest to teach my other friends and family these simple ciphers and even go as far as to teach them about the advanced cryptography their devices use everyday. I created this site as a better way to spread my love for cryptography.

To accomplish my task of teaching I had to create a fun and interactive experience. I did this by creating various demos and tools that are each accompanied by an easy to read explanation of what is going on behind the scenes.

Feel free to let me know your thoughts and how you think I could improve this project :)
