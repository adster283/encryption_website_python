    <h1>About this tool:</h1>
    </br>
    <p>Encryption is a fascinating thing to learn about. You can know everything there is to know about the algorithms
        used that have unlimited computing power but if you donâ€™t know the password that unlocks the given encryption.
        This is the foundation of modern day computing and without it anyone would be able to view everything you do
        online and everything you have stored on all your devices. It is the one security measure that protects us from
        the people that wish to do us harm.</p>
    </br>
    <p>To see the encryption in action using the above tool. If you'd like to encrypt a file you can click the encrypt
        button and supply a file and password that you like to lock the file with. The site will then return an
        encrypted version of the file which can only be viewed by giving the encrypted version of the file along with
        the same password back to this site. Because of how secure the encryption algorithm is, if you were to forget
        the password you'd never be able to see the contents of that file again.</p>
